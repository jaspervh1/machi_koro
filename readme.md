This is my attempt to make a version of the boardgame Machi Koro
which one can play against an AI opponent.
This way I hope to find out which are the best strategies in the game, 
whether some cards are overpowered. 
Ever since my son beat me thoroughly using a novel strategy I've been 
wondering if his method can be reliably beaten (I haven't figured it out).

I will be following along with https://github.com/mcandocia/machi_ai for 
Machi Koro and with https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhBuTD2QZNY&t for 
setting up the artificial intelligence networks.
